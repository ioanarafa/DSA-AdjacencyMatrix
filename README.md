Year I, semester II: Data structures and algorithms

course six: Adjacency Matrix

Definition: An adjacency matrix is a way of representing a graph as a matrix of booleans (0's and 1's).

About code:
  It read from a file: m = edges, n = nodes and x-y nodes.
  It allocate dynamic memory for a matrix and for each read combination we put "1" on the mat[x][y] position.
